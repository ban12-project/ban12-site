   * missing-input-response	The response parameter (token) was not passed.
   * invalid-input-response	The response parameter (token) is invalid or has expired. Most of the time, this means a fake token has been used. If the error persists, contact customer support.
   * bad-request	The request was rejected because it was malformed.
   * timeout-or-duplicate	The response parameter (token) has already been validated before. This means that the token was issued five minutes ago and is no longer valid, or it was already redeemed.
   * internal-error	An internal error happened while validating the response. The request can be retried.
